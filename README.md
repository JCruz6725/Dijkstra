# Dijkstra
Implementation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. This was a project that I did for my Networking class.

The main pricipla was to highluigh how data would be transfered through out the internet. Specifically how routers route data with the next hop.

Currently has a bug that needs to be lined out. 

BUG: The final itteration of the algorithm seem to break and not get the minmum distances. *Need too fix
